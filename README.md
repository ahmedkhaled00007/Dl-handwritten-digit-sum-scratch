# Deep Learning from Scratch – Digit Sum Classifier

This project implements a fully connected deep neural network from scratch using only NumPy to classify the **sum of two handwritten digits** (e.g., 3 + 7 → 10). It demonstrates a full end-to-end deep learning workflow without using high-level frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Overview

- **Goal**: Predict the sum of two digits using a neural network
- **Input**: Combined vector of two handwritten digits
- **Output**: Integer from 0 to 18 (the possible sums of two digits)
- **Tools**: NumPy, Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Dataset

The dataset is generated by combining two MNIST digits side-by-side:

- Each input has a shape of (28, 56), flattened into 1568 features
- Labels represent the sum of the two digits (range: 0 to 18)
- One-hot encoding used for training targets

## Neural Network Architecture

- **Input Layer**: 1568 units (flattened image of two digits)
- **Hidden Layers**: 512 → 256 → 128 → 64
- **Output Layer**: 19 units (for sums from 0 to 18)
- **Activation Functions**:
  - ReLU for hidden layers
  - Softmax for output layer
- **Loss Function**: Cross-Entropy
- **Optimization**: Gradient Descent (manual implementation)

## Implementation Details

Everything is implemented manually in NumPy:

- Parameter initialization using He initialization
- Forward propagation through all layers
- Backward propagation using chain rule
- Manual gradient updates
- Predict function with softmax and argmax
- Training loop with loss logging
- Test accuracy calculation


## Results

- Model successfully trained and tested with high accuracy
- Loss decreases consistently across iterations
- Code is written with clear comments and explanations for educational purposes

## Learning Outcome

This project was built as part of the **Neural Networks and Deep Learning** course by Andrew Ng. It helped strengthen understanding of:

- Deep learning fundamentals
- How forward and backward passes work under the hood
- Practical experience with NumPy and matrix operations

The code is fully documented and beginner-friendly. Anyone with basic Python knowledge can understand and experiment with this neural network.
